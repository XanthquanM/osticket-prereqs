<h2>Installation Steps</h2>
Welcome to my first in-depth tutorial. In this guide, we will begin by creating a virtual machine (VM) using Microsoft Azure via the Azure Portal.

Virtual machines are essentially remote computers that allow us to run and test software in a controlled environment. This helps protect our physical machines from potential issues or malfunctions during setup or experimentation.

Once your virtual machine has been successfully deployed, the next step is to connect to it using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). This allows you to interact with the virtual machine just like you would with a local computer.

After successfully connecting to your virtual machine, the next step is to enable Internet Information Services (IIS), which is necessary for the VM to serve web content and support applications like osTicket. To do this, open the Control Panel on your virtual machine and click on "Programs." Under "Programs and Features," select "Turn Windows features on or off" from the left sidebar. In the Windows Features dialog that appears, check the box next to "Internet Information Services." Then, expand the IIS section to ensure the proper subcomponents are enabled. Under both "Web Management Tools" and "World Wide Web Services," make sure all necessary features are selected. Most importantly, under "Application Development Features," expand the section and check the box for "CGI." Once all the required components are selected, click "OK" to apply the changes. Windows will then install and enable IIS with CGI support, preparing your virtual machine to host web applications.








l machine will be ready to host web applications.

Alright, now that IIS is up and running, we‚Äôre ready to grab the osTicket installation files.

You can download them directly to your virtual machine using this link:

üëâ [Download osTicket Installation Files](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1b3RBkXTLNGXbibeMuAynkfzdBC1NnqaD&export=download&authuser=0)

Just open a browser on your VM, paste the link above, and the download should start automatically. Once it‚Äôs downloaded, go ahead and extract the files somewhere easy to find ‚Äî like your desktop 

Now open iis as a admin register php within iis then reload iis‚Äú install osTicket-v1.15.8.zip‚Äù and copy the upload folder into ‚Äúc:\inetpub\wwwroot‚Äù rename upload to osTicket
