<h2>Installation Steps</h2>
Welcome to my first in-depth tutorial. In this guide, we will begin by creating a virtual machine (VM) using Microsoft Azure via the Azure Portal.

Virtual machines are essentially remote computers that allow us to run and test software in a controlled environment. This helps protect our physical machines from potential issues or malfunctions during setup or experimentation.

Once your virtual machine has been successfully deployed, the next step is to connect to it using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). This allows you to interact with the virtual machine just like you would with a local computer.

Now that you have successfully connected to your virtual machine, the next step is to enable Internet Information Services (IIS), which will allow the VM to serve web content. This is an essential step in preparing the environment for applications such as osTicket.

To Enable IIS with CGI:
On your virtual machine, open the Control Panel.

Click on Programs.

Under Programs and Features, select Turn Windows features on or off (located in the left sidebar).

In the Windows Features dialog that appears:

Check the box next to Internet Information Services.

Expand the Internet Information Services section.

Under Web Management Tools and World Wide Web Services, ensure that necessary subcomponents are also selected.

Specifically, expand Application Development Features and check CGI.

Click OK to apply the changes.

Windows will now install and enable IIS with CGI support. Once completed, your virtual machine will be ready to host web applications.

Alright, now that IIS is up and running, weâ€™re ready to grab the osTicket installation files.

You can download them directly to your virtual machine using this link:

ðŸ‘‰ Download osTicket Installation Files

Just open a browser on your VM, paste the link above, and the download should start automatically. Once itâ€™s downloaded, go ahead and extract the files somewhere easy to find â€” like your desktop or C:\inetpub\wwwroot (since that's where IIS serves files from by default).
